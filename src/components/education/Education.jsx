              I am an electrical and electronics engineering student. I'm in my
              fourth year(2022) of college. Everything about the engineering
              curriculum appeals to me because it encourages students to think
              outside the box. The development of logical thinking, objectivity,
              critical thinking, and creativity has greatly influenced how I see
              the world.
