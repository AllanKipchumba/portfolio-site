            <p>
              I enrolled in an intensive 6-month software engineering remote
              program at The App Brewery in London, led by Dr. Angela Yu. This
              program introduced me to the fundamentals of software engineering,
              with a focus on building web applications and secure databases.
              Through this experience, I learned the importance of continuous
              learning to stay relevant in a rapidly evolving industryâ€”a lesson
              that has stayed with me ever since. I am always on the lookout for
              new opportunities to learn and grow.
