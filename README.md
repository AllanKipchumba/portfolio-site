# Allan Kipchumba's Portfolio Website

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project description

This is my portfolio website project. The website contains vital information about myself, such as my bio, education, skills, and previous projects. The project was completed in 10 days. One thing I've learned from this project is how important it is to have a complete design before starting work on a project. It saves you a lot of time if you know exactly what you're working towards.
